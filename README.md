### Overview

The purpose of this repository is to preserve and make publicly accessible all
supplementary materials for the publication "A Spin-Flip Study of the Diradical
Isomers of Pyrrole, Furan, and Thiophene," submitted to the _Journal of
Chemical Physics_.

### Contents

- `supporting-information.docx`: Supporting information document matching the
version on the Publisher's website, in Microsoft Word format.
- `geometries/`: Directory of plain text files in XYZ format containing Cartesian
coordinates of 
    * the structures of the lowest singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) structures of all
    diradical isomers, and
    * the closed-shell ground-state singlet (S0) structures of the fully saturated
    parent molecules (furan, thiophene, and pyrrole)

>Note: XYZ files in the `geometries/` directory also contain information about the
>level of theory for the optimization on the comment line (line 2)
