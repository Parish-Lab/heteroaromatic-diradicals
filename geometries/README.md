Structures of All Parent Molecules and Diradical Isomers
===

Cartesian coordinates (in units of Angstroms) for each molecule considered
here, specifically:
    * the structures of the lowest singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) structures of all
    diradical isomers, and
    * the closed-shell ground-state singlet (S0) structures of the fully saturated
    parent molecules (furan, thiophene, and pyrrole).

>Note: Also provided on the comment line (line no. 2) of the XYZ files is
>information about the level of theory at which each structure was optimized.
